    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>Tic Tac Toe is a game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (either X or O).</p>
    <p>The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.</p>
    <p>If all 9 squares are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game is a draw.</p>

  <div class="strategies">
    <h2>Strategies</h2>
    <p>1. Start from the center square if you are the first player. This gives you more opportunities to win.</p>
    <p>2. Always watch for opportunities to create a line of three of your symbols while blocking your opponent.</p>
    <p>3. Corners are strategic. If you control corners and the center, you have a higher chance of winning.</p>
    <p>4. Pay attention to your opponent's moves and adapt your strategy to block their winning moves.</p>
